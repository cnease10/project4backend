1, Take a class for something new, "There are tons of places that have classes. You can often find them at the local library, a community college, a community center, or even at a craft store or hardware stores."
2, Hit up a go-kart track, "Tons of fun even though it can be a little expensive. I’ve never met anyone who went around a go-kart track and was bored doing it. Sure, it won’t last all day, but it’s a fantastic add-on activity. Just remember to keep it fun and not too competitive."
3, Go sky diving or bungee jumping,"Sure, it’ll be expensive. But it’ll definitely be a date that you’ll both remember for a long time. Just make sure that both of you are game, if your partner isn’t into it, don’t pressure them to do it."
4, Backyard camping or just go camping,"This one does require a tent and sleeping bags. Leave the phones in the house or the car. Tell ghost stories, look up at the stars, play cards by flashlight, talk, and enjoy the lack of distractions."
5, Join a fun looking meetup together,"There are a lot of meetups these days, and they cover almost every interest. Find one that you think you’ll both find interesting and give it a shot. You can search for meetups in “your town/city” on Google or see what Meetup.com has to offer."
6, Take a dance lesson,"You don’t need to hit the club to dance, you can take a dance class! Bonus points if you take a dancing class with a type of dancing that you both haven’t tried. Just try not to step on too many toes."
7, Go ziplining,Always nice to do something that gets the heart pumping. It’s a perfect short date idea if you don’t have a full day to have the date.
8, Do some geocaching,"It’s like hiking plus surprise presents! It can be a lot of fun searching for the geocache together, and you might just visit some remarkable places neither of you has been before."
9, Go bowling,"There is a bowling alley in almost every town and city. Chances are you haven’t been bowling for a while. Go give it a shot. If there is an extreme difference in skills you might not want to keep score, maybe just make it a learning session."
10, Drink and write dirty limericks,"This is another short date idea that works really well when you mix it with other date ideas. All you need is some booze, a pen, and paper or cell phone, and the rhyming scheme of limericks."
11, Do yoga together with a twist,"Yoga and booze, yoga outside, hot yoga, naked yoga, all kinds of things you can do to make it more interesting. This is another one that is probably best done with couples that are pretty comfortable around eachother. Also, it’s a little on the short side. But yeah, it can be a blast to take yoga and remix it and see if you can make it a fun date activity."
12, Go horseback riding,"Another one that can get a little expensive. But it’s not a standard date idea, and if you or your date has never tried horseback riding, it’s something you won’t forget."
13, Go to a VR café / arcade,"These are becoming more and more popular. Check on Google Maps to see if one has popped up in your area. If there is one in your area, check it out together. You can have an action-packed, creative, or relaxing date at the VR arcade. This is especially memorable if neither of you has tried a full VR set up."
14, Try metal detecting,"This can be on the expensive side; you can get a decententry-level metal detector for around $200. But if you calculate the cost of dinner at an upscale restaurant and a movie ticket plus a snack for two, it’s not that far off. At the end of the date, you’ll have a metal detector! Anyways, it can be a fun excuse to walk around and chat and maybe find somecool stuff. Just make sure to take turns."
15, Have a water gun/balloon fight,"This one is definitely a summertime date idea. Running around spraying each other with water and lobbing water balloons can be a great way to have fun and beat the heat. Just make sure to have something lined up for when you finish as this is kind of a short date idea."
16, Go to a local nonprofessional sports game,"Like a high school football game or a little league game. Choose a side to cheer for or cheer for opposing teams. Lots of fun and usually quieter than professional sports games. Plus, a lot cheaper. It’ll give you alot of chances to talk, and you’ll be able to support a local team!"
17, Rent a skateboard or longboard and give it a go,"So, this one. This one is a bit risky. It can be a lot offun no matter what your or their skill level is. But if one of you gets seriously injured, well that’s not fun at all. A trip to the hospital does not make for a good date. So, choose this date idea with an ounce of caution."
18, Try on ridiculous clothing/outfits you would never normally wear,"The mall or a thrift store is the perfect place to do this. It can get hilarious really quick. And who knows, you might find that you look terrific in an entirely different style than you usually rock."
19, Play some board games or card games at a board game café or a gaming store,"So, depending on how competitive you both are, this idea can be a little dangerous. (Looking at you monopoly.) But as long as you both aren’t taking it too seriously; it can be a blast. Pick out a favorite board game or choose a new one that looks interesting."
20, Go to the nearest amusement park or water park,"Amusement parks and water parks are always a blast, so if you’ve got one not too far away give it a go. It’s, of course, better if you can do it on a weekday, but if you both work all week, weekends are doable as well."
21, Find a place with a rock-climbing wall and go rock climbing,"Another fun physical activity you can do together. It won’t be an all-day thing, but it’s great for a short date or as an add-on or back-update."
22, Play a sport or do an activity you are both horrible at or have never done,"Some possibilities might be table tennis, bowling, badminton, or something similar. Making sure you are both horrible at it is vital. You don’t want either one of you taking it too seriously. It should be good for a laugh."
23, Rent a convertible sports car or luxury car and cruise around all day,"This is another one that is on the expensive side. But it’s a lot cheaper than buying a sports or luxury car! Just make sure to check the weather before you get the convertible."
24, Play pinball and switch between balls,"This is more of a short date activity idea. It’s probably not a full date idea unless you both REALLY love pinball. But it can be a lot of fun, especially if you try to beat a high score together on the machine or if you try out a bunch of different machines."
25, Use just a compass and a map to get to someplace cool,"Who needs Google Maps? Go old school with a compass and map and test both of your ability to find your way to a cool destination."

27, Adult kids party,"Have a kids birthday party for yourselves. With a cake (the sillier, the better), a present for each of you, a pinata, pin the tail on the donkey, etc. Basically, whatever party games and decorations you want to rock. Because why should kids have all the fun?"
28, Make a homemade pinata together,"This one might stretch over a couple of date nights. Basically, you can plan and start your pinata on one date, let it dry, and then on another date, you can decorate it and smash it. Fill it with whatever fun stuff you want. Maybe even each sneak in some surprises for each other."
29, New food night,"Try out some new food items that you have no idea if you will like or not. Grab a bunch of fruit from the grocery store that you have never eaten. Grab a bunch of snacks/food/drinks from an international food store that you have no idea what they taste like. Have a taste testing night. You could also film each of your reactions."
30, Fancy fast food feast,"Dress in your finest and use your best plates, glasses, and silverware and candles and have a fancy fast food meal. It can be at home or in the fast food restaurant. Go super fancy and sophisticated with your burger and fries. You could even pair it with a nice box of wine."
31, Go donate blood together,"This one is a much shorter date idea, but it could easily be added to another date idea. It’s definitely not a typical date idea, but giving blood is an awesome thing to do, so why not do it together?"
32, Play fake tour guide/art expert, "Go to a museum or historical location. Pretend to be the tour guide or expert and make up outrageous “facts” about the art or the history of the area for your date. Then switch roles. Bonus points if you pickup random people for your tours."
33, Antique shop creativity,"Make up histories for the items, buy old photos and make up identities and maybe put them in a photo album, buy an old appliance or machine and try to use it, restore an old piece of furniture. Antique stores have a lot of neat stuff in them. You’ll both probably come home with some neat trinkets or decorations for your house. Plus, you get to guess what some of the old tools/appliances were used for. Lots to talk about and check out in antiquestores."
34, Go fossil hunting,"This one depends a lot on where you live. Some places it’s really easy to find fossils, some areas not so much. Look up finding fossils in your area and see where the best places are to look."
35, Create a new type of dessert together,"Desserts are great for experimentation because if you slap enough sweet stuff together, it will probably still taste good. So, let your creativity run wild, make a mess of your kitchen, and get decadent with somesweets."

37, Find some cool science experiment videos on YouTube and try them out,"Whether they fail or succeed, you are both sure to have a good time trying them out. Just make sure to go shopping ahead of time to get all the ingredients and create a playlist of stuff to try. You can both choose some videos to try before the date."
38, Take a factory or brewery or bakery tour,"Sounds like a field trip, but it’s usually pretty entertaining. If nothing else, it’s a date idea that neither of you has tried! Plus, if you go for a bakery or brewery tour, you get some tasty samples."
39, Go to a local fundraising event,"Do a little good on your date and have fun in the process.There are always groups running fundraising events, and they can be a lot of fun."
40, Go foraging for edible plants & berries and make a meal with them,"You’d be surprised how many plants we consider weeds are edible.

41, Drive around looking for yard sales and see if you can find any cool,"It’s like treasure hunting! You can find out what kind of stuff they are into and maybe find some super cool things for yourself. Plus driving around looking at random people’s stuff leads to some funny conversations."
42, Make a list of missions to accomplish and see how many you can get,"Some examples might be: buy ice cream from an icecream truck, find 3 pay phones, get a bull’s eye, jump over four benches, etc. You need a little creativity for this date idea, but it’s entirely doable. You could also get your date to send some mission ideas as well. This date idea is adaptable and is as fun as you make it."
43, Pretend to be an ultra-wealthy couple and test drive expensive cars,"It can be a lot of fun pretending to be someone else. You can make up fake names and backstories for yourselves as well. See how well you can pull it off."
44, Learn about local history and visit some historical spots,"Okay so not everyone is interested in history, but this can be a great way to learn more about your town.

46, Buy some cheap watercolor paint and get a drawing pad to do portraits of eachother,"A great idea if you are both horrible at painting or are both aspiring painters. If one of you is way better than the other, it might not be the best choice. If you are both horrible at painting, it can be a hilarious way to spend a date. And if you are both good at painting, you get to connect over your love of art."
47, Buy a bunch of seeds and plant them all over in random places, "Sounds weird but can be a lot of fun visiting new places and secretly or not so secretly planting seeds. It makes you look at your surroundings in a new way. Plus, it’s very cool when you start seeing the plants begin to sprout and bloom."
48, Paint and build a model you are both interested in,"Any Walmart or Target will have quite a few models for you to choose from.

If it turns out terribly, at least you both can have a laugh, and you have a good story."
49, Go to an old cemetery and look at the graves,"So, this is definitely not everyone’s idea of a good date. And it really should not be your first or second date. It’s much better for couples who have been together for a while. But a lot of people enjoy the peaceful nature of graveyards and guessing at the stories from the gravestones or trying to find the oldest graves."

But I decided to leave it in because I think it is awesome when people get involved in their local politics. Local politics has a big impact on your daily life and can be a form of politics you can actually make a difference in. Even if it’s just a local town hall meeting or a vote on some local decision. Go check it out. It may be a bit of a dull date, but it’s probably a date idea you’ve never done!"
56, Give graffiti a shot but in a legal way,"Watch some tutorials online, then head to the hardware store. Grab a piece of plywood or particle board and some spray cans, and you are off to the races.

From a kazooor harmonica to a violin or tuba, instruments run the gamut of prices."

61, Brainstorm a new product or business,"Yeah, so this is kind of a weird one. It sounds super boring but can actually be a lot of fun if you both get into it. That being said, you and your date need to be relatively creative to pull it off. But if you do, you can find out a lot about the other person, what they like, what their skills are, and who knows you might come up with a business idea you would like to try."
62, Find places that are supposedly haunted in your area and visit them at,"If one of you is easily scared, this might not be the best date idea. But if you are both into horror movies and enjoy a good scare, this can be a lot of fun."

64, Go to a science center if your city has one,"Science centers are usually filled with all kinds of fun, hands-on activities. You might think that they are mostly for kids, but what are adults?

65, Hit up an art museum,"Whether you are both into art or not, an art museum can be a quiet place to walk around and have a conversation.

66, Play some putt-putt,"Chances are you haven’t done putt-putt in quite a while. But, it can be a lot of fun as long as you don’t take it too seriously. Never take putt-putt too seriously, it would be way too frustrating. And with a name like putt-putt, it’s okay to be a little silly."

70, Rent a boat/sailboat/paddleboat,"For this one, a body of water is a must. But most towns or cities have a few lakes around. And there is a good chance someone is rentingout things that float. So, go out on the water and have a good time."
71, See a play or musical,"Support your local theater scene and check out a play. You won’t be able to talk during the play, but then again you can’t talk during movies either. And whether it’s good or bad, you’ll still have something to talk about afterward. It’s a great spin on the traditional dinner and a movie."
72, Catch a sunset,"I highly recommend scouting out a good spot ahead of time,and of course, sunsets are best enjoyed with your beverage of choice. You can do a bit of stargazing afterward too, as long as the light pollution isn’t too bad."
73, Play tour guide and take them to your favorite spots,"By being a tour guide, you can share some of the places you really enjoy and see if they enjoy the same types of things you do. Plus, you are already familiar with the place so you can show them around and make sure they get the best experience possible."

75, Buy a cheap drone and take turns flying it around and probably crashing,"You can get a drone for the price of a couple of drinksthese days, and they are a ton of fun to play around with.

Relax and chat while it charges upafter you burn through the battery."

80, Head to the zoo,"Zoos are great places to walk around and talk. It’s casual and relaxed, and with so many animal exhibits, there is always something to talk about.

84, Hit up a local artist art gallery,"Most towns and cities have at least one art gallery for one or more local artists. Go check it out and pretend you are art critics.

85, Find a nearby quirky museum,"There are so many small quirky museums. There might just be a few in your city or town or at least not too far away. They can make for fun road trip destinations and can be a lot of fun to walk through and check out all the unique exhibits."

Then if you want some talking time, you can always pause and discuss the book or podcast. A great idea if you are on a road trip as well."
117, Make some different types of homemade salsa,"After you make the salsa, what else is there to do but to have some margaritas, and taste test your salsa with chips. Maybe make it into a taco or nacho night. Loads of different types of salsa to try to make to suit all different types of tastes."
118, Do some legal urban exploring,"If you live in a city, there are all kinds of interesting buildings, ruins, nook and crannies, and other interesting spots perfect for urban exploration. So if you both have a passion for exploring and live in a city, this can be a really cool date idea. Just make sure your date is totally on board, wear appropriate clothing, and stay legal."
119, Go bird watching,"Bird watching sometimes gets called boring, but really, it’sa great way to get outdoors. It gives you a reason to wander around in nature.Even if you’ve never done it, there are plenty of online guides out there to get started in your area. If nothing else, it’s probably something the both of you have never done before."
120, Go jogging,"If you are both into fitness and jogging, a jog can be a great way to bond over something you both love. But this suggestion really only works if you are both into jogging. If just one of you is, or if neither of you is, you might give this idea a pass."
121, Go on a walk through a park,"It’s relaxing, it’s free, it gives you plenty of time to talk. What’s not to love about taking a walk in the park on a date? You could bring a frisbee, pack a lunch, and make a day of it. A lot of the other date ideas go well with a walk in the park."
122, Find a beautiful place to skip rocks,"This date idea is a great way to relax while still enjoying nature. You won’t be doing it all day, but it’s a great add-on to a trip to ap ark."
123, People watch at a crowded location,"Sitting in a crowded place takes the pressure off having a conversation. You can just chat idly about this or that. Or you can discuss the people passing by and what their lives might be like. This one is really dependent on the person. Some people love sitting and people watching, and some don’t. One fun thing to do is create imaginary and fantastical backstories forthe people you are watching."
124, Volunteer somewhere,"Loads of places are looking for volunteers. Have a volunteer date night, and you’ll be doing something awesome while getting to spend timew ith your date."
125, Learn some Tai Chi,"Relaxing but still difficult. It’s great for your health and wellbeing and can make for a fun and interesting date idea. Especially if neither of you has tried Tai Chi before. There are plenty of YouTube videos, or you could see if there is a class. This is more a short date idea so try to have something else on had to do before or after."
126, Learn a sleight of hand trick together,"This is kind of a neat one, because who doesn’t like a good sleight of hand trick? Now you can be the one pulling quarters from people’s ears. There are plenty of YouTube tutorial videos to choose from, just find one that you both like and practice, practice, practice."
127, Go on a hike,"No matter where you live, there is probably a hiking trail or at least some kind of walking path within driving distance. Hikes are great because you can chat while you walk. Plus, you can get out in nature and get some exercise."
128, Go to your local library and rent a book to take turns reading to eachother,"With this one, the sillier it is, the more fun it is. Findan interesting fictional book and create some bombastic character voices. You can take turns reading, or each of you does a character."
129, Get stuff done date,"Okay so this sounds horrible, but it actually can be fun, and it’s definitely productive. Oh, and it’s meant mostly for couples who live together. Find some chores or stuff you can do together, blast some music, and open up a bottle of wine or a few beers. It’s a way to make getting stuff done a little more fun, and you get to spend some time together."
130, Find a public place with a lot of litter and clean it up,"Similar to the volunteering or giving blood, this one isreally uncommon for a date idea. And you have to make sure your date will be into it. But if you are both up for it, cleaning up a public space can be are warding way to spend the afternoon."
131, Get lyrical and write an original song, bonus points if you can also bust","This is a date idea that can be done at a bar or coffeeshop, at least the writing can be, you might want to do the actual singing somewhere else. It can be a blast collaborating and is a great way to get creative. Just make sure to have fun with it and don’t take it too seriously."
132, Take some trial fitness classes,"Most fitness places have trial classes for free. Give one or two of them a shot. It’ll make for a lively date, and you might even find a class that you are really into."
133, Make some YouTube videos,"Having a common goal or task can be a great way to have a date. And what better than to make goofy videos to put on YouTube. Even if you don’t end up posting the videos, it can be a lot of fun making them together and then looking over them."
134, Both of you download an app/game in which you have to walk or travel,"There are a lot of these games for both Android and iOS. If you search augmented reality games, you’ll probably find quite a few."
135, Pick out workout videos on YouTube and do them together,"Definitely better if you both are into fitness and working out. Doesn’t really work so well if neither of you is into fitness or if only one of you is."
136, Try to take artsy pictures of each other in different locations,"Basically, pretend to be photographers. Everyone appreciates a good picture of themselves. And even if neither of you is a professional, that shouldn’t stop you from trying to get some awesome pictures. See if you can get some photography tips online before heading out on the date."
137, Find an interesting neighborhood or suburb and walk and talk,"Whether it’s a super wealthy area or a historic district, find a cool neighborhood and walk around. You’ll be surprised at all the details you pick while walking that you might not normally see while driving."
138, Make slow motion videos with your phone,"Most cell phones these days have a slow-motion feature on them. You would be surprised how cool everyday stuff looks when you smash it or crush it. You could also do some stunts. A full grown adult trying to do something they used to do all the time as kids can be pretty hilarious. Just make sure not to get injured."
139, Go to the nearest airport and get to where you can watch them take off,"You’ll have to find somewhere that isn’t unbelievably noisy. I don’t want you all to be losing your hearing. But if you can find a great spot, it really is neat to see these giant tubes of metal defying gravity."
140, Look through very old newspapers or magazines at the library,"Some folks will find this to be super boring, and some will find it extremely interesting. It all depends on the person. But it can be really interesting to find out what people 70 or 80 years ago were concerned or interested in. You’ll probably find that there are a lot of parallels to today’s news. Plus old ads are really cool. Just remember when you are going through them not to get too loud."
141, A book club for two,"Each of you picks a short story, novella, or graphic novel for the other to read, and then you get together on the date and discuss them over drinks. This one is an excellent idea if you are both into books. But I wouldn’t suggest it unless you are both avid readers. If someone doesn’t read much, it might make them feel like they are preparing for a book report."
142, Do a seasonally themed date,"Do some stereotypical seasonal activities together like building a snowman if it’s winter or going to the beach or pool if it’s summer. For fall or spring, you could carve a pumpkin or paint Easter eggs. Have seasonal food and drinks after the activity."
143, Plan the perfect vacation,"This works best if you share a laptop. Otherwise, you end up both looking at your phones or looking at your separate laptop. Find a country or countries to visit, choose what you want to do, pick some impressive hotels. You’ll be able to see what they find fun and exciting and maybe get some more date ideas for next time."
144, Build sandcastles together (no beach necessary),"No beach nearby? Not to worry. The hardware store sells playsand. Get some of that, a flat surface, some water, a place you don’t mind getting wet and sandy, and you are good to go. You could do a full-on beach day away from the beach."
145, Make matching t-shirts,"So you can either get those iron on ones, or you can get a company to print the designs on a shirt and send them to you. But the fun partis designing your shirts. Making them as ridiculous as possible. If neither of you has done much digital design, I would recommend checking out Canva for putting the images together."
146, Make masks,"Most craft stores will carry some type of blank masks, but if they don’t, there is always Amazon. Then just get together hang out and decorate your masks. You can both do your own thing or have them based on a theme. Whatever works for both of you. Don’t worry if they turn out horrible, that’s part of the fun. Make sure to get some photos together after you finish!"
147, Do each other's make up,"So this is probably more for established couples looking forcreative date ideas. And you have to make sure both of you are down for it. But if you do this one, it can lead to some HILARIOUS results."
148, Bring your SO to work day,"This one is kind of a weird date, and it definitely depends on where you work. But with a lot of workplaces, you can show your significant other around, and they can see what you do most days. Plus a lot of workplaces have some great perks you can take advantage of for a date! This is probably best done onyour day off but might be cool depending on the job."
149, Start learning a new language together,"Sure, you could learn some of the more popular ones. But why not try an uncommon language or something like Esperanto. It would be great to have a language that you both know, but most of those around you don’t."
150, Buy and read some comic books together,"Both of you will at least have to have a passing interest in comic books. But if you both do, it can be neat to start a new series that you haven’t read before. Try to pick one that both of you don’t know much about. That way, you can both experience it with fresh eyes."
151, Take turns drawing a picture,"One person draws one part, and then the other does the next part. Or if you want a really interesting picture, one person draws until a timer runs out and then the next person goes."
152, Go get henna tattoos together,"It’s like getting regular tattoos together but a much lower level of commitment. Just be sure that it isn’t in a place that will interfere with your job, they last 1 to 4 weeks."
153, Make a collage,"Test your artist prowess by making a collage, it takes awhile and provides you both with a lot of time to chat and get to know eachother. Plus it pairs pretty well with drinks."
154, Have an impromptu 4th of July celebration,"Or any holiday really. Make a Thanksgiving dinner for the two of you or wear green and go out and have a bunch of beers and bring green food coloring for the beer."
155, Write a story together,"This is another date idea that is a little bit short but is still pretty fun. Get a piece of paper, you write two sentences of a story then pass it to them. Then they write two sentences. And then you write two sentences, they write two sentences, and so on. The story gets pretty crazy pretty quickly."
156, Jump around at a trampoline park or obstacle course,"If your city or town has one of these, they are a blast. Alot of laughs, a decent workout, and a whole lot of fun. Just make sure not toget injured."

158, Go to a plant nursery and pick out a plant or two,"You can buy a plant or tree together and take care of it or buy one for each of you. It’s a great way to have a souvenir from the date. Just try not to accidentally kill it like I do most of the plants I get. Plus nurseries have a lot of cool plants, and you can chat as you wander through all the plants."
159, Go to an aquarium or aquarium store,"Name the fish and make up backstories for them. Create alittle imaginary drama for them like they are finned day time soap opera characters."
160, Do a photo booth crawl and make silly photos at every booth you can,"This one is a spinoff of the “crawl” idea, and can be a great way to have a lot of fun on a date.

Bonus points if you pick up props for the photos at a dollar store."
161, Find a project on Pinterest or Instructables and make it together,"This works well because it gets you both working together.

Plus, there are so many projects out there you are sure to find one that both of you are excited about doing."
162, Watch a movie in the park or at a drive-in movie theater,"If there are no drive-ins in your area, make your own. Buy some snacks, find somewhere scenic to park, grab a tablet, put it on the dash."
163, Buy some kites and go fly them,"Who doesn’t like flying a kite? And when was the last time you flew a kite? This is one of those rom-com ideas, but it’ll be fun. Perfect for a trip to the park."
164, Create a poster for a fictitious band or movie or one for a real one,"This can be a really fun project. Let your imagination go wild and try to make it as funny as possible. If you aren’t into digital design, I would recommend Canva to make it easier. It’s free and pretty awesome. If you really want to go all out, you can get it printed out at a print shop and put it up. It would make a great souvenir of a great date."
165, Get a couple’s massage,"This is one of the more expensive ideas, but they are a great way to relax together and have some downtime. Afterward, I’d have something relaxing planned like sitting on a bench near a lake or river to continue that chill vibe."
166, Have an upscale picnic,"Location is key, so scout out a great spot at a local park. Then go all out with some wine (if they allow booze), cheese, sliced meats, and French bread. Spread out a blanket on the ground or at a table, relax, and enjoy being in each other’s company."

168, Movies from your childhood night,"Find some movies that had a big impact on both yourc hildhoods, pop some popcorn, and enjoy your trip down memory lane. It will be a great way to connect on some common ground, and you might be surprised at all the things you don’t remember about your favorite childhood movies."
169, Pillow fort party,"Just like what it sounds, make a pillow fort together. And now that you are adults, you can make it even more amazing than the ones you made as a kid. Once inside, do whatever you want, watch a movie, have drinks and chat, snuggle, do some gaming, whatever floats your collective boats!"
170, Cook a new recipe together,"Find a recipe for something neither of you has ever made and make it. It’s easy to chat while cooking and you get a dinner out of it as well. You can even make shopping for ingredients part of the date. A bottle of wine or beers helps the cooking process stay fun.

172, Create your own couple holiday including traditional food,"Make your own holiday that is customized to you and your significant other.This works better for established couples and can be a lot of fun setting up a new tradition. You can even break it up into two dates. The first date for planning and the second one for celebrating the holiday."
173, Pick a restaurant with a type of cuisine that neither of you has tried,"This one is a bit of a gamble because you won’t know if you both will like the food or not.

176, Try to make convoluted cocktails,"This always a lot of fun. You can either try to make some crazy cocktails/shots that have recipes, or you can try to make an original cocktail. This one can be expensive if you go all out, but if you find the right recipe, it doesn’t have to be too crazy expensive."
177, Make flip books,"This is a creative date idea that might not fill a full evening, but it is a great way to spend time together doing something creative.

You could even put them together so that where one leaves off the other person’s begins."
178, Brew some beer together,"You’ll need a kit or a bunch of equipment for this one, and it can get a little expensive.

All that being said, though, doing something together is very rewarding."
179, Pick a dessert recipe and go shopping. Then make a dessert together","Ice cream is a great choice, there are tons of DIY homemadeice cream methods. And it would work well with the pick your own fruit date idea. But really any baked good is a great choice."
180, Attempt to learn calligraphy,"So, attempt is the key word here.

183, Choose a series of movies to do a daylong movie marathon,"Don’t forget the popcorn! This is a pretty chill date idea for those who like staying at home.

184, Watch a movie you've both seen a bunch and try to make memes from it,"There are so many memes from movies and shows.

185, Write letters to folks who might want them or folks who don't,"Are you both passionate about something? Write a letter to someone who might be able to do something about it.

190, Do a themed photo shoot (professional or amateur),"Time to get all dressed up and get goofy. You could stick with one theme or try a few themes. Professional photoshoots are always great, but this one works just as well with cell phone cameras."

198, Go to an open mic night. Bonus points if one or both of you gets up on,"This one can be a bit hit or miss because at some open mic nights, it’s a little challenging to have a conversation with all the noise.
